This repository contains the code used in the NeurIPS 2020 paper titled "Provable Overlapping Community Detection in Weighted Graphs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07150). Matlab files pertain to experiments on synthetic grahps and python files pertain to experiments on real-world graphs (PPI networks). For the real-world experiments, one must run the python files in the following order: bio_raw_to_p.py, spa.py, lp.py, bio_val.py. The PPI datasets (including validation sets) can be downloaded from the "Supplementary information" section of the paper titled "Detecting Overlapping Protein Complexes in Protein-Protein Interaction Networks" by Nepusz et al. (https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.1938).
